## Cleaned Data Downloading

Due to the size of the cleaned data files being too large to upload to GitHub, please download all 8 files from the following link and insert files in the same folder as `LinearRegression.ipynb` and `LogisticRegression.ipynb`. Data should start with "DivvyData_part[X].csv" to run Jupyter files without changes. Another option is to run the `DataCleaning.ipynb` file, which will download all of the files, then move into same folder as `LinearRegression.ipynb` and `LogisticRegression.ipynb`.

## Data Cleaning

To run the data cleaning file, you must run through `DataCleaning.ipynb` in Google Colab in order to properly download the files at the end of running. Use the following link and click "Runtime" --> "Run All" to run the full file and download cleaned data

## Regression

To run `LinearRegression.ipynb`, open the file in Virtual Studio Code and ensure all 8 data files are located in the same folder. Run all to run full analysis. Note that running took approximately 25 minutes on my device

## Classification

To run `LogisticRegression.ipynb`, open the file in Virtual Studio Code and ensure all 8 data files are located in the same folder. Run all to run full analysis. Note that running took approximately 50 minutes on my device

## Report

My compiled report can be found in the file `DivvyReport.pdf`. All of the plots used in the report can be found in the folder "Plots" folder.
